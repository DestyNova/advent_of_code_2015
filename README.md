# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2015 ðŸŽ„

A collection of solutions for the [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015/) programming puzzles. I'm going to attempt these in [Picat](http://picat-lang.org) and maybe other languages if the mood is right.

I didn't solve these puzzles in 2015 so am in no rush to complete them every day, but feel free to check out my [2020](https://github.com/DestyNova/advent_of_code_2020) and [2021](https://github.com/DestyNova/advent_of_code_2021) repos which were mostly done in Haskell.

I'd recommend the Advent of Code to anyone -- they're really fun and interesting puzzles, and I've learned a lot from doing them.
