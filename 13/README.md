# Day 13: [Knights of the Dinner Table](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/13)
*Picat: [Both parts](https://github.com/DestyNova/advent_of_code_2015/blob/main/13/main.pi)*

Yay, a constraint solving problem.

## Part 1

For some reason I spent a really long time encoding this problem. I really wanted to convert the input to a table of preferences, then constrain the seating assignment against the table. This is almost certainly possible in a much more straightforward way in Picat, but I was too lazy to properly read the docs.

## Part 2

This part was very straightforward and just required adding one to the size of the seating list. I managed to completely mess this up because I was running the program on the sample input and thought it was doing the wrong calculation. Oops.

## Reflections

It would help to read the constraint solving section of the Picat manual more carefully so I can take advantage of it properly.

## Error collection

None.
