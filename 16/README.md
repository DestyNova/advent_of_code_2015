*Picat: [Part 1](https://github.com/DestyNova/advent_of_code_2016/blob/main/16/part1.pi), [Part 2](https://github.com/DestyNova/advent_of_code_2016/blob/main/16/part2.pi)*

A puzzle that looked like a constraint satisfaction problem at first but turned out to be much easier.

## Part 1

While reading the problem description, this seemed to me like another CSP, but by the time I got to the constraints at the end it was clear that a single pass through the data was all that was needed.

## Part 2

Again I expected that some complex search would be needed, but no! Swapping the equality checks for a few conditionals and the appropriate greater/lesser than comparison.

## Reflections

Surprised at how easy this one was compared to previous days.

## Error collection

None.
